# Use Cases

The dispersive cloud has three core use cases, monitor, analysis, and report. For the management of account information, the dispersive cloud also develops use cases for login/log out and account management.

 This is a short overview of our core use cases.

## Login/logout

TFor collecting the mouse movement data for real-time analysis, the dispersive cloud simulates a standard work environment to collect user mouse movement information.
 
In our user pool at Cognito, there is previous information for current employees. 
 
When a new employee signs in to their account with their email, their information will dynamically record in our user pool.

## Monitor

All employee information will store in the cloud database.
 
When a new employee login into the company website, our system will build an employee person's biometrics behavior profile based on their unique mouse movement.
 
Normally, it takes a strand workday to collect mouse movement to generate a biometrics profile. For this demonstration, we shortened the profile generation process into 5 actions.
 
As you can see, when an employee uses the company website, their mouse movement will automatically cover three biometrics parameters and automatically compare with the distribution of previous biometrics behavior data to identify the account leak threat.

## Analysis

When tier1 security analyst login into the dashboard of the security system.
 
The analyst can check all alerts that generate by our dynamic cloud database.
 
The analyst can investigate on alert details. 
 
On alert details, the analyst will have an overview of the status of abnormal behavior and distribution of historical biometric behavior by our three biometrics parameters.
 
Analysts also can investigate each parameter for further details.

## Report

Dispersive cloud develops a reporting system for tier1 analysts to generate the report for the performance using our security system to the security manager.
 
The analyst can check the threats detected on various platforms with different periods.
 
The analyst can download the daily, weekly, monthly report for further investigation.

## Add employee

In the user manage selection, the analyst can add or delete monitored employee accounts.
 
Once the employee account deletes from user manage selection, its corresponding alerts will also remove from the dashboard.
